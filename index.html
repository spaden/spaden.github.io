It was a fine morning stepping out from my bed i noticed that shyla woke up early before me. As usual the same as every weekend but something really seems not to be alright.

I can feel it in my blood but there\'s nothing to worry about that\'s what i keep saying it to myself. Having finished my daily routine began to think what my life would be if my shyla was not with me.

I feel happy after all these years.Why am i felling happy. Is it she or the friendship we just made.Whatever she feels enlightened now.

We started walking together now with just 1 inch distance between us, not like the way before this small talk.

				  <h3> Suspense episode</h3>
				  <p> “I love you shyla, I had no option but to depart them forever.” – I said gazing at the full moon.
“You had no option, really that’s what you are gonna say to cops?” – a voice which I was very familiar uttered from behind. When I look back there she is with a enraged look at me.
“I couldn’t even imagine you did this those innocent people”
“Stay back! Don’t ever touch me again. I am gonna inform the cops now”
She started to unlock her phone.
I rapidly thrived towards her and pulled her phone away from her.
“Sorry baby not now.” – I said to her. She had a astonished look at me.
Then i picked her up from ground and kept her in the back door. She tried her best to get rid of me.
Does she really thinks that I turned out to be a vicious psychopath.
I tied her hands with the help of the mobile charger. She was screaming.
“Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
